# Pet Thing
I made this for the hackclub YSWS Hackapet or whatever it's called

this was my first time using pygame and animating was a pain

controls made for the 3 button device (arrow keys)
left: move left or down
right: move right or up
up: change between up-down and left-right modes

all 3 at the same time to throw

goal is for the dog to catch the ball without it touching the ground
