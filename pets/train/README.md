# My First Little, Slightly Broken, Yet Endearingly High-Maintenance Train That Always Finds a Way to Keep Chugging Along (hopefully)
## Description
Congratulations! You have finally saved enough money to buy your own locomotive! You have been dreaming about this moment for years. 

Unfortunately, the train you bought is not in the best condition. It is a little broken and constantly needs maintenance. If the train is not maintained properly, it will break down and you will lose all your money.

## Objective
The further your train goes, the higher your score. At each station, you can refill your train's condition bar (⬇️ down arrow).
Increase and decrease the speed of your train by pressing the ➡️ right and ⬅️ left arrow keys.
If your train's condition bar reaches 0, your train will break down and the game will end.

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic game mechanics
- [x] Infinite scrolling background with smooth transitions
- [ ] Day/night cycle
- [ ] More trains & upgrade system
