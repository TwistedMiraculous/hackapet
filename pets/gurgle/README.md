# GURGLE!!! 👽👽👽👽👽

gurgle is your alien cat! do not LET him die or else!!! he likes to see ufos, which gives him the ability to call on his followers to make him happy! you can also feed him and make him float! like a ~~tamagotchi pet~~

## Controls 👽👽👽


⬅️ left arrow = eat food (makes him not hungry)
⬆️ up arrow = menu (see stats!)
➡️ right arrow = use special item! (makes him happy)
⬆️ ⬅️ menu + left arrow = make gurgle float! (he becomes happier but his food decreases quicker!)
⬆️ ➡️ menu + right arrow = toggle hiding text

    # CONFIG
    FOOD_MAX  =  50
    HAPPINESS_MAX  =  50
    SAVE_DELAY  =  30  # seconds
    HIDE_TEXT  =  False
    LOCK_FPS  =  12
    SPECIAL_ITEM_CHANCE  =  1  /  20  # 1 in 20 chance, happens every second (so "guaranteed" in 20 seconds)

You can tinker 👽 with this to make it harder or easier, i just wouldn't set the max amount of food high unless you want text out the screen
